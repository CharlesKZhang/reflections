How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    helps to narrow down to certain lines of code to look at

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Understand what errors you are making

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    instead of having many versions which may not work, or not complete, or not making sense, you can do logical saves

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because the logical commit happens across all files. You can see waht changed for each file for each commit in one log instead of multiple 
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can view all the commits for the files and git diff can compare the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can easily revert. Make bigger changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    projects
