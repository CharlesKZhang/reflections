When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote respository if you are working on a project that multiple people work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something that you may be overwritten if Git automatically pulls from GitHub.
