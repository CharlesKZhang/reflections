When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote respository if you are working on a project that multiple people work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something that you may be overwritten if Git automatically pulls from GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used to "clone" someone's repository from github to your github account so you can customize it. Clone allows for you to copy a repository from a github account or your local machine to your local machine. A branch allows one to create another path for one to edit and change their commits without affecting the master branch.
