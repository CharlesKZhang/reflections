When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote respository if you are working on a project that multiple people work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something that you may be overwritten if Git automatically pulls from GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used to "clone" someone's repository from github to your github account so you can customize it. Clone allows for you to copy a repository from a github account or your local machine to your local machine. A branch allows one to create another path for one to edit and change their commits without affecting the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that you have the most up to date file that you can work off of locally. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would have to put the code in dropbox. I would have to make it read only and only edit access to a select few. There are no branches, just one. This would make it difficult to work parallely. I would then juse commadn prompt to compare the changes of the files and merge that way.
